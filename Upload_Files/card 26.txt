Abstract
A patient is described having severe aortic stenosis and severe pulmonary disease contraindicating general
anaesthesia for standard surgical aortic valve replacement as well as Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)
using apical or direct aortic access. Dimensions of femoral and subclavian arteries were prohibitive for vascular
access for TAVI. Therefore, the patient was treated by TAVI under full consciousness in spinal anaesthesia using a
conduit to the common iliac artery. Thus, this case describes an alternative access route and anaesthesiological
handling in otherwise untreatable TAVI candidates.

Introduction
Since 2002 Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has
been used in patients, where frailty or concomitant diseases result in
too high surgical risk for open heart surgery. With the currently
available TAVI devices most patients can be treated from a technical
standpoint using femoral, subclavian, apical or direct aortic access or
rarely, carotid or iliac access [1-3]. In our first more than 200 cases,
prohibitive access problems had not been an issue for denial of a TAVI
procedure, but such a case was then encountered, and a solution with
TAVI under full consciousness via a retroperitoneal access was finally
used [4]. We found it relevant to present the case, since a treating a
fully conscious patient using this access and anaestsiological handling
has not previously been described.
Case Report
A 57 years old female developed heart failure due to severe aortic
stenosis while undergoing intensive care admittance for severe
pulmonary problems. She had been known with severe chronic
obstructive lung disease, albeit with remarkable good physical function
despite advanced disease. Furthermore, she attended with regular
intervals a local hospital for previously estimated non severe aortic
stenosis.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of her
local hospital with a severe case of Pneumococcus pneumonia, but 18
days later she was transferred to the regional university hospital due to
recurrent pleural effusions. A total of 79 days under intensive care was
needed due to several pleural drainages, tracheotomy and difficult
weaning from respiratory therapy. Prior to discharge the patient was
discussed at an interdisciplinary heart valve conference, due to the
stenotic aortic valve, and its impact on the present situation. Her left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) had dropped from normal value
>60%, at the last outpatient control 10 months prior to admittance, to
25% during the ICU stay. She had a bicuspid aortic valve with severe
calcifications, grade 2+
 insufficiency and an estimated valve area of 0.5
cm2
. Despite the low LVEF the patient could produce a gradient of
72/42 mmHg (peak/mean). Pulmonary pressures were estimated to 55
mmHg.
Surgery was the preferred option, so it was decided to re-evaluate
her 3 weeks after discharge from the ICU. Spirometry then showed
forced vital capacity of 41% and forced expiratory volume of 21% of
reference values, and still minor relapses of pneumonia. Full treatment
for congestive heart failure could not be offered due to hypotension.
Surgery was found too risky at this stage, and it was decided to
perform valvuloplasty of the stenotic valve in local infiltration
anaesthesia as a bridge to possible later surgery. Transesophageal
echocardiography and cardiac 64 slice computerised tomography scan
showed normal coronaries, aortic annulus of 25 mm by area
evaluation. Femoral and subclavian vessels were straight without
obstructions, but with diameters of only 4 x 4 mm. A balloon
valvuloplasty was then performed in local anaesthesia using a 22 mm
balloon. At follow-up 4 weeks later LVEF had risen to 35%-40%, but
clinically she was still in New York Heart Association grade 3-4 heart
failure. Pulmonary function was unchanged, and hence the risk of
pulmonary complications too high for direct aortic or apical TAVI.
Sheathless femoral access was considered, but found prohibited by the
>50% oversizing of femoral arteries needed to accommodate an 18F
delivery system. Proximal right common iliac artery was just 6 mm,
and an iliac access under full consciousness was offered to the patient
with informed consent that termination of the access procedure would
be done, if combined spinal anaesthesia and intravenous opioids could
not control the pain.
Hence, a spinal catheter was placed in L1-L2, initially using 8 mg
Bupivacain. Later 5 mg more added and infusion of Remifentanil 0.07
µg/kg/min started for pain relief while stretching the peritoneum.
Activated Coagulation Time was kept just above 250 sec using
unfractionated heparin.

Retroperitoneal exposure of the right common iliac artery and an
end-to-side anastomosis with 8 mm clamped Dacron®
 (Vascutek Ltd,
Glasgow, UK) prosthesis was done.Except for advancing the delivery
sheath through the unclamped conduit, a standard 29 mm Medtronic
Corevalve™
 TAVI procedure was then performed with initial redo
valvuloplasty with a 25 mm balloon. The implant was complicated by a
deep dive to the left ventricular outflow tract, probably due to the
bicuspid valve. After a prolonged traction process with the valve still
attached to the delivery catheter, an acceptable position was obtained
with grade 1 paravalvular aortic insufficiency and the valve released.
However, the valve dived again under release, resulting in a grade 3
insufficiencies. A second valve was implanted 4 mm higher, reducing
the paravalvular leak to grade 0-1. The delivery system and wire were
removed and the access Dacron tube shortened to approximate 10 mm
from the anastomosis site and closed with sutures. Standard closure of
abdominal wall, subcutis and skin was done. The patient was
hemodynamically stable during the procedure and no vasopressors
needed.
The patient was observed for 4 hours in postoperative intensive care
unit before transfer to an ordinary ward. Two units of erythrocytes
were given the second post procedural day, but otherwise the
postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on day
10. Echocardiography before discharge showed discrete paravalvular
aortic insufficiency, a peak gradient of 24 mmHg and mean gradient of
14 mmHg. The aortic valve area was estimated to 1.6 cm2
. Three
months after the procedure the patient was in NYHA 2b, lung
function unchanged, but she managed her household herself and was
without diuretic therapy. LVEF had normalised, and no paravalvular
leak remained. Pulmonary pressure was slightly elevated at estimated
40 mmHg, judged due to her pulmonary insufficiency.
Discussion
Retroperitoneal access for TAVI has been described under general
anaesthesia, but not in a wake patient, and this case illustrates, that in
the rare patient with prohibitive access due to anatomic or
physiological constraints, this is an option [5]. Tough the patient
tolerance of the retroperitoneal manipulations in a conscious state
even with spinal anaesthesia was uncertain, we saw this as her only
option, and in this case turned out to be possible. If this experience can
be extrapolated to other patients with similar problems remains to be
seen, and as further downsizing of TAVI access vessel requirements
seems to be ongoing, the described option will be relevant for a
minority of patients in the future. For these patients, however, it is
important that, instead of having to resort to the dismal prognosis of
untreated significant aortic stenosis or repeated valvuloplasties, an
option of retroperitoneal access is available that can be performed in a
conscious state without intubation and artificial ventilation and
highlights the need for multidisciplinary approach to the TAVI
patient.
